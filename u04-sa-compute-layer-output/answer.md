(Ngl I'm not sure this is correct! Someone should review me... lel.)  
  
First, multiply each input by its corresponding weight:  
[4, 0.5, 2.0] * [1.5, -3.0, -1.0] = [6.0, -1.5, -2.0]  
  
Then add the bias vector:  
[6.0, -1.5, -2.0] + [2.0, 2.0, 2.0] = [8.0, 0.5, 0.0]  
  
So the output vector of the layer is [8.0, 0.5, 0.0].
