Answer: One of the biggest ethical issues of this application of AI is that these types of models tend to be
trained on old resumes of people that were hired in the company from potentially a large span of time. This
means that the biases of the employer will show through the model, and result in a model that is just
as much or more biased than the human employers that the model is created to replace.

Additionally, there may be privacy concerns since you are collecting personal information.

Also, the AI system may use complex algorithms that are tough to understand. It would be challenging to understand why the system is making the predictions it does. This could lead to difficulties in evaluating the fairness and accuracy of the system.
