c. multi-layer perceptrons.  
  
In Prof. Vander Linden's lecture, we learned that a single layer of **perceptrons** couldn't handle the complex logic necessary for helpful ML models.  
**Decision trees** might *use* complex logic, but they're not the technological development that *enables* this.  
**Multi-layer perceptrons** solved the problem posed with single-layer perceptrons!  
**Convolutional neural nets**, according to [this article](https://towardsdatascience.com/the-brief-history-of-convolutional-neural-networks-45afa1046f7f), weren't implemented until the 1990s.
