Refer to Unit 4's reading of using SGD on image classifier with pixel simillarity. Which of the following is NOT one of the seven steps required to turn the function into a machine learning classifier?

A) Initialize the weights.
B) Use the weights to predict what an image is.
C) Calculate the gradient, which measures how changing each weight would change the loss.
D) Update the pixel values of the image.
E) Repeat the process until the model is good enough or the training process is stopped.
