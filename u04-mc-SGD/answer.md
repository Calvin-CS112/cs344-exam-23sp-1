The answer is D) Update the pixel values of the image.

The seven steps are: 

1. Initialize the weights.
2. Use these weights to predict what an image appears to be.
3. Based on these predictions, calculate how good the model is.
4. Calculate the gradient, which measures for each weight how changing that weight would change the loss.
5. Step all the weights based on that calculation.
6. Go back to step 2, and repeat the process.
7. Iterate until you decide to stop the training process.
