Some possible examples of data augmentation:
1. Rotating images
2. Scaling images (up or down)
3. Sliding images (right, left, up, down, etc.)
4. Mirroring/Flipping images
5. Changing color (hue, saturation, brightness, color scale, etc.)
6. Adding noise
7. Cropping image

Some possible reasons augmentation is useful:
1. Can increase the "size" of dataset
2. Diversify dataset (ex. letters upside-down)
3. Improves generalization capabilities
4. Model learns from different angles, scales, positions, etc.
