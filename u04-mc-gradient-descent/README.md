A particular weight in a model has a small positive gradient. To improve the model using Stochastic Gradient Descent you should...

a. adjust the weight to be slightly larger because that will increase the loss

b. adjust the weight to be slightly larger because that will decrease the loss

c. adjust the weight to be slightly smaller because that will increase the loss

d. adjust the weight to be slightly smaller because that will decrease the loss
